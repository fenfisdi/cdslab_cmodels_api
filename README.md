### For non-pipenv users

We will try to keep the ``requirements.txt`` file up to date. However, if you find out that some dependencies were not installed, we recommend updating this file via the following command:

```bash
$ pipenv lock --dev -r > requirements.txt
```

You can now configure the virtual environment using your preferred framework.

**Note:**  before updating the ``requirements.txt`` file make sure you have already installed ``pipenv`` via ``$ pip install pipenv`` or by any other means.
